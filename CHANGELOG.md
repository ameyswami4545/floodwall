# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `RateLimit::new` and `Admission::new` now panic on a limit that could
  never admit anything sensibly: a `burst` below `1.0` (which used to
  rate-limit every intent silently), or a NaN, infinite, or negative
  parameter. `RateLimit::try_new` returns an `InvalidRateLimit` error
  instead of panicking. (FW-103)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `intent`: `Intent`, `Action` (apply / scale / destroy), `AgentId`,
  `Priority`, and `BlastRadius` - the attributed unit of work.
- `admission`: `Admission` controller with per-agent token-bucket rate
  limiting (`RateLimit`) and a bounded priority queue (highest priority
  first, FIFO within a priority) that applies backpressure when full.
  Logical-clock time, so behaviour is deterministic.
- `policy`: the `Policy` trait, the `Verdict` type, and three reference
  policies - `NoGlobalDestroy`, `BlastNeedsPriority`, `ResourceAllowlist`.
- `gate`: `Gate`, a deny-overrides stack of policies that records a full
  per-policy breakdown for every decision.
- `ledger`: `Ledger`, an append-only FNV-1a hash chain with `verify()`
  that detects any retroactive edit to history.
- `Floodwall`: the control plane tying admission, gate, and ledger
  together (`submit` / `tick`).
- A `floodwall` demo binary that floods the wall with 4000 intents across
  five agents.
- CI (fmt / clippy `-D warnings` / test / build) and Dependabot for cargo
  and GitHub Actions.
